As one of the author of the journal "Visualization of Flood Intensity Level Data and Identification of Priority Flood Affected Areas in Jakarta," I contributed to the analysis and visualization of flood data from 2013 to 2020. My responsibilities included a proper report and dashboard from the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) and Kaggle to ensure reliability and readability with visualization. I played a key role in giving ideas for interactive dashboards in Tableau to identify flood frequency, severity, and impact across Jakarta's administrative regions. By highlighting priority areas such as North and West Jakarta for improved water catchment systems, this project provided actionable insights for flood mitigation and urban resilience planning
